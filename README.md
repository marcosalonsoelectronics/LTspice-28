Material of video LTspice-28: How to create a Piecewise Linear BJT Model

Available at: https://youtu.be/OoB-C3Vtkhg

This video shows how to create a piecewise linear model of a bipolar transistor. The model is intended to be used when analyzing bipolar transistor circuits using simplified piecewise linear models. These models are not usually available in spice-based simulators like LTspice. More sophisticated models are usually available for bipolar transistors in spice-based simulators. However, this makes it difficult to verify the analysis of the circuit using piecewise linear models of the bipolar transistor. With the proposed model the simulation will allow to verify the analysis made using the piecewise model. Both analysis and simulation results should match. Piecewise models for both the NPN and PNP transistor are presented. The implementation as components in LTspice is also shown. The components are incorporated in the Control.lib available from my website. This library is available free from my website.
